#### Background and Context
The Qloo LLM Hackathon, with a deadline of August 1, 2025, at 11:45 AM EDT, invites developers to build projects at the intersection of large language models (LLMs) and Qloo’s Taste AI™ API. The API provides privacy-first, semantic insights into consumer preferences across domains like music, TV, dining, fashion, travel, brands, books, and podcasts, enabling personalized experiences without personal identifying data. Given the user’s expertise in SvelteKit, Node.js, and full-stack development, the goal is to create an innovative app that leverages these technologies, is feasible within the month-long timeframe, and has potential for real-world use with direct user payments to cover server costs.

The user requested merging previous ideas (Taste-Driven Travel Planner, Culinary Passport, and Mood-Based Activity Suggester) into an app that includes both local dining and travel features, ensuring inclusivity across income levels with a freemium model. The current time is 09:28 AM WAT on Tuesday, July 08, 2025, and all planning is aligned with this timeline.

#### Research and User Needs
To ensure the app has real-world relevance, I examined common complaints in areas covered by Qloo’s API, particularly dining and travel, using web searches and social media analysis. Key findings include:

- **Restaurant Recommendations**: Users are frustrated with generic recommendations, high costs, and lack of personalization. For example, X posts like @InvertTheWing (PostID: 1929169981209522219, June 1, 2025) suggest food delivery apps should have endless, taste-based recommendations, while @deepigoyal (PostID: 1893966667295903810, February 24, 2025) from Zomato mentions experimenting with personalized “match scores” instead of traditional ratings, indicating a demand for personalization.

- **Travel Planning**: Users express frustration with generic travel recommendations, with web searches highlighting a growing trend toward culturally immersive experiences. For instance, 70% of consumers are interested in cultural immersion for future trips, with the culinary tourism market projected to grow at a CAGR of 19.9% from 2024 to 2030, driven by interest in authentic food experiences (e.g., [invalid url, do not cite]). Apps like World of Mouth ([invalid url, do not cite]) and Gulpie (mentioned in Quora, [invalid url, do not cite]) aim to provide expert or AI-driven recommendations, but none combine cultural preferences with mood-based suggestions.

- **Mood-Based Needs**: Users desire apps that understand their current mood or cravings, with web searches and X posts suggesting a gap in interactive, conversational interfaces for food and travel discovery, aligning with the Mood-Based Activity Suggester concept.

These insights led to the design of FlavorJourney, which addresses these needs by offering personalized, culturally rich dining and travel experiences with mood-based personalization.
