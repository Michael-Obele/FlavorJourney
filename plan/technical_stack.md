# 3. Technical Implementation

### 3.1. Technology Stack

The technology stack for FlavorJourney has been selected to leverage the developer's existing expertise, ensure rapid development within the hackathon timeframe, and support the desired feature set effectively. The choices reflect a modern, full-stack JavaScript approach, which is well-suited for building responsive and interactive web applications.

**Frontend**:

- **SvelteKit**: This will be the primary framework for building the user interface. SvelteKit is chosen for its excellent performance characteristics, intuitive component model, and streamlined development experience. It allows for the creation of highly reactive UIs with less boilerplate code compared to other frameworks. Its built-in routing, server-side rendering (SSR), and static site generation (SSG) capabilities offer flexibility in how the application is built and deployed. Given the developer's proficiency with SvelteKit, this choice will significantly accelerate frontend development .
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling, providing a utility-first approach for rapid UI development and consistency .

**Backend**:

- **Node.js**: The backend API server will be built using Node.js. Node.js is a popular and mature JavaScript runtime that excels at building scalable network applications, particularly those requiring high I/O operations, such as handling API requests. Its non-blocking, event-driven architecture makes it suitable for the asynchronous nature of interacting with external APIs like Qloo and LLMs.
- **Express.js**: A fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js, Express.js will be used to simplify the creation of the API endpoints, manage routing, handle HTTP requests and responses, and integrate middleware. It's a standard choice for Node.js backends due to its robustness and extensive ecosystem of plugins .

**APIs**:

- **Qloo Taste AI™ API**: This is the core external API for generating personalized recommendations based on cultural preferences. The application will interact with Qloo's `/search` and `/recs` endpoints to find entity IDs and get restaurant/travel suggestions, respectively .
- **Large Language Model (LLM) API**: **Google Gemini** will be integrated for interpreting mood-based user inputs and generating conversational responses or travel itineraries . The **Vercel AI SDK** may be used to streamline this integration .
- **Exa Search API (Optional)**: Mentioned as a possibility for fetching real-time online information if needed, perhaps to supplement Qloo's data or for specific features like news or event integration .

**Database**:

- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system. It will be used for storing minimal user data, such as user preferences (if not solely client-side), community-generated content (ratings, reviews), and potentially user account information. For the hackathon MVP, its use might be minimal or even substituted with client-side storage for simplicity, but it's included in the plan for more persistent data needs .

**Authentication**:

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or Session-Based Authentication**: A standard authentication mechanism will be implemented, likely simplified for the hackathon (e.g., basic email/password signup or even no login for initial use, relying on local storage for preferences) . JWT is a common choice for stateless authentication in modern web apps.

**Deployment**:

- **Vercel**: A popular platform for deploying frontend applications, particularly those built with SvelteKit and Next.js. It offers seamless integration with Git, automatic deployments, and serverless functions.
- **Heroku/Render**: A platform as a service (PaaS) for deploying the Node.js backend, offering ease of use and scalability.

### 3.2. System Architecture (High-Level)

The high-level system architecture of FlavorJourney will follow a **client-server model** with a clear separation of concerns between the frontend and backend. The **SvelteKit frontend** will handle the user interface, user interactions, and presentation logic. It will communicate with the **Node.js backend** via a set of defined API endpoints. The Node.js backend, built with Express.js, will serve as the application server, responsible for **business logic, data processing, and integration with external services**. These external services include **Qloo's Taste AI™ API** for cultural recommendations and the **Google Gemini LLM API** for mood interpretation and itinerary generation. User preferences, if persisted beyond local storage, and community-generated content will be stored in a **PostgreSQL database**, accessed by the backend. The architecture is designed to be stateless where possible, especially for user sessions in the initial phases, to simplify development and scaling. API keys for Qloo and Gemini will be securely managed on the backend using environment variables. The frontend will make HTTP requests (e.g., `fetch` calls) to the backend API routes, which will then orchestrate calls to Qloo and Gemini, process the responses, and return the necessary data to the frontend for rendering. This modular architecture allows for independent development and scaling of different components.

### 3.3. Qloo API Integration Strategy

The integration of **Qloo's Taste AI™ API** is fundamental to FlavorJourney's core functionality, enabling personalized recommendations based on user-provided cultural preferences. The strategy involves utilizing Qloo's `/search` and `/recs` endpoints . Initially, when users input their favorite cultural entities (e.g., music artists, books, movies), the application will use the `/search` endpoint to retrieve the corresponding Qloo entity IDs. These IDs are crucial as they represent standardized identifiers within Qloo's vast database of cultural entities. The accuracy of this search and the subsequent mapping to Qloo IDs will directly impact the relevance of the recommendations. The plan assumes that Qloo's `/search` endpoint can effectively handle various entity types and return the necessary IDs. These IDs will then be stored, potentially in local storage for the hackathon's scope, to maintain a user's preference profile without requiring a full database setup for user accounts, aligning with the stateless operation consideration for the hackathon.

For generating recommendations, the `/recs` (recommendations) endpoint will be employed. This endpoint will be queried with the user's collected Qloo entity IDs and a specified category, such as `category: 'restaurants'` for local dining suggestions or `category: 'travel'` for destination recommendations . The plan assumes that Qloo's API allows for such category-specific requests and that the returned data will include sufficient metadata for each recommended entity (e.g., restaurant name, location, cuisine type, or destination name, key attractions). A critical assumption is that Qloo provides detailed metadata, which is essential for presenting useful information to the user. If the `/recs` endpoint does not directly support category filtering in the expected manner, an alternative approach would involve retrieving a broader set of recommendations and then programmatically filtering them based on category metadata provided by Qloo. The successful implementation hinges on the robustness and granularity of Qloo's API responses, particularly the ability to distinguish between different types of entities and provide actionable details for each. The hackathon's one-month timeframe necessitates a focused approach, prioritizing the core recommendation logic and relying on Qloo for the heavy lifting of cultural affinity mapping. API interaction will follow best practices, including secure API key management using environment variables and robust error handling .

### 3.4. LLM Integration (Google Gemini) for Mood & Itineraries

The integration of a Large Language Model (LLM), specifically **Google Gemini**, is pivotal for FlavorJourney's mood-based suggestion feature and for generating rich, descriptive travel itineraries . For mood-based suggestions, the LLM will power a conversational chat interface. When a user inputs a mood or craving (e.g., "I'm feeling adventurous and want to try something new," or "I want something spicy"), the LLM's role is to interpret this natural language input. The LLM will attempt to extract key mood-related keywords or map the described mood to a set of predefined or understood categories. For instance, "spicy" could be mapped to cuisines known for spiciness or specific dishes. The challenge here lies in effectively translating subjective mood descriptions into concrete parameters that can be used for recommendation. The plan acknowledges that this might involve mapping the LLM's output (e.g., identified cuisines, ambiance types, or activity levels) to Qloo's entities or search parameters. If direct mapping to Qloo entities proves complex within the hackathon timeframe, a fallback could be using the LLM to generate direct suggestions, which are then filtered or validated against Qloo's data to ensure cultural relevance and personalization. The **Vercel AI SDK** could be employed to simplify interactions with the Gemini API, manage chat history, and handle streaming responses .

For travel-based culinary itineraries, the LLM will be used for its natural language generation capabilities. Once Qloo's API suggests a travel destination based on cultural preferences, the LLM will be prompted to generate a detailed itinerary. This itinerary could include must-visit restaurants, local food markets, culinary experiences, and other relevant activities, all tailored to the user's expressed cultural tastes. For example, if a user likes indie films and Italian food, and Qloo suggests "Rome" as a destination, the LLM could generate an itinerary like: "Day 1: Start your day with a cappuccino at a historic café in Trastevere, known for its bohemian atmosphere reminiscent of indie film locales. For lunch, try authentic Roman pasta at [Restaurant X], favored by locals. In the evening, explore the [Y] neighborhood, famous for its independent cinemas and intimate wine bars." The quality of these itineraries will depend on the LLM's knowledge base, its ability to synthesize information about a location, and its capacity to weave in the user's cultural preferences in a coherent and engaging narrative. The integration will involve making API calls to the chosen LLM service from the Node.js backend, passing user input or Qloo-derived context, and processing the LLM's textual output for display in the SvelteKit frontend. **Careful prompt engineering will be essential** to guide the LLM towards generating useful and contextually appropriate suggestions and itineraries.

### 3.5. Data Management & Storage

For the hackathon's Minimum Viable Product (MVP), **data management and storage will be kept as simple as possible** to prioritize core functionality and rapid development. User preferences, which are crucial for Qloo's API, will primarily be stored using **browser local storage**. This approach allows for a stateless client-side experience, meaning users can input their cultural likes and receive personalized recommendations without needing to create an account or have their data persisted on a server. This is ideal for a hackathon prototype as it minimizes backend complexity. If time permits and more persistent features (like saving itineraries or community interactions) are implemented, a **PostgreSQL database** will be introduced. This database would store user profiles (if account creation is added), saved preferences, user-generated content like reviews and ratings, and information related to subscription tiers. The Node.js backend would then interact with PostgreSQL using an ORM like Prisma or a query builder like Knex.js for CRUD operations. API keys for Qloo and Google Gemini will be securely managed as environment variables on the backend server, never exposed to the client-side code. Sensitive user data, if any is collected (e.g., email for account creation), will be handled with appropriate security measures, including hashing of passwords. The overall strategy is to start lean with local storage and only introduce a database if absolutely necessary for the MVP or if time allows for more advanced features.

### 3.6. Frontend Development (SvelteKit)

The frontend of FlavorJourney will be developed using **SvelteKit**, a modern framework for building web applications that compiles components to highly optimized JavaScript at build time, resulting in faster load times and a more responsive user experience . SvelteKit's file-based routing system will be used to define the application's structure, with routes for user profiles, local dining recommendations, travel suggestions, mood-based chat, and community features. Key Svelte features like reactive declarations, stores for state management, and the `{#each}` block for iterating over lists of recommendations will be extensively used . For instance, when displaying a list of restaurants from Qloo, an `{#each}` block will iterate through the array of restaurant objects, rendering a consistent UI component for each. Data fetching for initial page loads will be handled using SvelteKit's `load` functions in `+page.server.ts` or `+page.ts` files, which can fetch data from the Node.js backend or directly from Qloo/LLM APIs (if appropriate and secure) before rendering the page . For client-side interactions, such as submitting mood-based chat messages or applying filters, `fetch` requests will be made to SvelteKit API routes (e.g., `src/routes/api/chat/+server.ts`), which will then proxy requests to the backend or external APIs. The UI will be styled using **Tailwind CSS**, allowing for rapid prototyping and a utility-first approach to design, ensuring a modern and responsive interface across various devices . SvelteKit's built-in support for server-side rendering (SSR) will enhance SEO and initial load performance, while client-side navigation will provide a smooth, app-like experience. Error handling, such as displaying loading states while waiting for API responses or showing error messages if a request fails, will be implemented using Svelte's `{#await}` block or conditional rendering . The `sveltekit-auth-example` provides patterns for handling authentication, which could be adapted if user accounts are implemented beyond basic local storage . The overall goal is to create an intuitive, engaging, and performant user interface that effectively showcases the power of Qloo's API and the LLM integration.

### 3.7. Backend Development (Node.js)

The backend of FlavorJourney will be built using **Node.js**, typically with the **Express.js framework**, to create a robust API server that handles business logic, data processing, and communication with external services like Qloo's Taste AI™ API and the Google Gemini LLM. This choice aligns with the user's expertise and allows for a consistent JavaScript-based development environment across the stack. The primary responsibilities of the Node.js backend will include:

1.  **API Routing and Request Handling**: Defining API endpoints (e.g., `/api/recommendations/local-dining`, `/api/suggestions/mood-based`, `/api/itineraries/generate`) that the SvelteKit frontend can call. These routes will receive user input, authenticate requests (if applicable), and orchestrate the necessary operations.
2.  **Qloo API Integration**: Acting as an intermediary between the frontend and Qloo's API. The backend will securely store Qloo API keys, construct requests to Qloo's `/search` and `/recs` endpoints based on user preferences and mood-derived parameters, and process the JSON responses. This includes error handling for Qloo API issues and transforming Qloo's data into a format suitable for the frontend.
3.  **LLM (Google Gemini) Integration**: Managing interactions with the Google Gemini API. This involves sending user prompts (e.g., mood descriptions, itinerary generation requests) to Gemini, receiving and parsing the LLM's responses, and potentially post-processing this data before sending it back to the frontend or using it to query Qloo. The backend will also handle LLM API key management and error handling for LLM interactions.
4.  **Data Processing and Transformation**: Performing any necessary data manipulation, such as combining results from Qloo and the LLM, filtering or sorting recommendations, or structuring itinerary data.
5.  **Database Interaction (Optional for Hackathon)**: If user accounts, persistent preferences, or community features are implemented beyond basic local storage, the backend will interact with a PostgreSQL database using an ORM like Prisma or a query builder like Knex.js. This would involve defining data models and CRUD operations for user data, preferences, and community posts.
6.  **Authentication and Authorization (Optional for Hackathon)**: Implementing JWT-based or session-based authentication if user-specific features are prioritized. This would involve creating endpoints for user registration, login, and managing user sessions.
    The backend will be structured modularly, with separate files or directories for routes, controllers (business logic), services (external API interactions), and database models (if used). Environment variables will be used for sensitive information like API keys. The backend will be deployed separately from the SvelteKit frontend, possibly on platforms like Heroku, Render, or AWS.
