# 2. Key Features and Functionality

### 2.1. User Onboarding & Profile Creation

The user onboarding process for FlavorJourney is designed to be **intuitive and engaging**, serving as the foundational step for personalized recommendations. Upon first use, users will be prompted to create a profile. A key component of this profile creation will be the input of their **cultural preferences**. This will be facilitated through a user interface built with SvelteKit, likely employing a combination of searchable dropdown menus, multi-select options, and free-text input fields. Users will be encouraged to specify their favorite entities across various cultural domains such as **music (artists, genres), books (authors, titles, genres), films (titles, directors, genres), fashion brands, and potentially even podcasts or art styles** . This initial input is crucial as it provides the primary data points for Qloo's Taste AI™ API to build an understanding of the user's taste profile. The more information a user provides, the more refined the subsequent recommendations can be.

During the hackathon, the implementation for storing these preferences will prioritize simplicity and speed. Options include using the **browser's local storage** for a completely stateless client-side experience for the initial prototype, or a minimal database setup (e.g., PostgreSQL) if user accounts and persistence are deemed essential for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). If a database is used, it will store these preference mappings (e.g., user ID linked to Qloo entity IDs). The Qloo API's `/search` endpoint will be utilized to allow users to find and select specific entities (e.g., searching for "Beyonce" to add her as a favorite music artist, which would then be stored using her Qloo entity ID) . The onboarding flow will emphasize the benefit of providing this information – that is, more accurate and tailored recommendations. The process should be designed to feel like an exploration of one's own tastes rather than a tedious data entry task, perhaps with playful prompts or visual cues. The aim is to gather sufficient initial data to make the first set of recommendations meaningful, while also allowing users to edit and refine their preferences at any time.

### 2.2. Personalized Local Dining Recommendations (Qloo Integration)

A cornerstone feature of FlavorJourney is its ability to provide **personalized local dining recommendations** based on the user's established cultural preferences. Once a user has completed their initial profile setup, or even with partial information, they can access this feature. The core mechanism for this will be the integration of **Qloo's Taste AI™ API**, specifically utilizing its recommendation endpoint (`/recs`) . The application will send a request to this endpoint, including the user's selected cultural entity IDs (derived from their profile) and specifying the `category: 'restaurants'` parameter to ensure the recommendations are focused on dining establishments. The Qloo API is expected to return a list of recommended restaurants, and the application will display these to the user. The display will ideally include key details for each restaurant, such as its **name, location (address or general area), type of cuisine, and potentially an average price range or rating**, assuming Qloo's API provides such metadata .

To enhance usability and personalization further, especially within the premium tiers, **filters will be implemented**. These filters will allow users to narrow down recommendations based on specific dietary needs (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free – if Qloo metadata or a supplementary data source supports this) and price range (e.g., $, $$, $$$). The **free tier** of the application will offer basic restaurant recommendations, providing immediate value to all users. The **premium tier, potentially priced around $1 per month**, will unlock these advanced filtering capabilities, catering to users who require more specific results . The user interface will be designed to make browsing and selecting restaurants a seamless experience, perhaps with map integration (if time permits and relevant APIs are available) or clear, concise cards for each recommendation. The underlying assumption is that Qloo's API can effectively map cultural tastes (e.g., a preference for indie films and jazz music) to compatible dining experiences (e.g., a cozy, eclectic bistro with live music). The success of this feature heavily relies on the richness and accuracy of Qloo's restaurant data and its recommendation algorithms.

### 2.3. Mood-Based Culinary & Travel Suggestions (LLM + Qloo Integration)

The **mood-based suggestion feature** is a key differentiator for FlavorJourney, designed to address the common scenario where users have a specific craving or emotional state but struggle to articulate it into a standard search query. This feature will be powered by an integrated LLM, with **Google Gemini** chosen for its advanced natural language understanding and generation capabilities . Users will interact with a **chat-like interface** where they can freely describe their mood or desire in natural language. Examples of such inputs could be "I'm feeling adventurous and want to try something new and exotic for dinner," "I need comfort food after a long day," "I want a lively atmosphere for a group celebration," or even "I'm planning a solo trip and want to go somewhere peaceful with great local food." The LLM's role will be to interpret these free-text inputs, extract the underlying intent, key attributes (e.g., "spicy," "romantic," "budget-friendly," "authentic"), and emotional tone.

Once the LLM has processed the user's input, it needs to translate this understanding into actionable requests for Qloo's API or generate direct suggestions. The LLM will attempt to identify cultural entities or descriptors from the mood input that can be fed into Qloo's `/search` or `/recs` endpoints. For example, if a user says, "I want something like that cozy café from my favorite indie film," the LLM might try to identify the film, then use Qloo to find similar "cozy café" atmospheres. The **free tier** will likely offer basic mood-based suggestions for local dining, perhaps with a limited number of interactions or less refined results. The **premium tier** could unlock more sophisticated mood-based travel suggestions and a higher degree of personalization . The challenge lies in creating a robust and reliable mapping between the LLM's interpretation of mood and Qloo's structured data, ensuring that the final recommendations are both contextually relevant to the user's current state and aligned with their long-term cultural preferences. The "Moodish" case study, for instance, explicitly mapped moods to food types using machine learning, which, while different in implementation, validates the concept of mood-to-recommendation systems . The **Vercel AI SDK**, which supports Svelte and Google Gemini, could be a valuable tool for streamlining this integration, offering hooks for building chat UIs and managing AI model interactions .

### 2.4. Travel-Based Culinary Itineraries (LLM + Qloo Integration)

FlavorJourney aims to extend its personalized recommendations beyond local dining to encompass **travel-based culinary experiences**, a feature particularly appealing to users planning trips. This functionality will also heavily rely on the synergistic integration of **Qloo's Taste AI™ API and Google Gemini**. The process will begin with Qloo's API: when a user expresses interest in travel recommendations, the application will query Qloo's `/recs` endpoint, this time specifying `category: 'travel'` and providing the user's cultural preference entity IDs . Qloo is expected to return a list of potential travel destinations that align with the user's tastes. For example, a user who likes specific types of music, art, and literature might receive suggestions for cities known for their vibrant cultural scenes in those areas, which also boast rich culinary traditions.

Once a destination (or a shortlist of destinations) is identified through Qloo, **Google Gemini will be employed to generate a detailed culinary itinerary** for that location. This is where the LLM's natural language generation and extensive knowledge base become crucial. The LLM can be prompted to create a day-by-day or meal-by-meal plan that includes must-visit restaurants, local food markets, unique culinary experiences, and specific dishes to try, all tailored to the user's initial cultural preferences and potentially any mood-related input provided for the trip (e.g., "a relaxing food tour of Paris," "an adventurous street food exploration in Bangkok"). The LLM can weave in contextual information, historical tidbits about dishes, and practical advice. For instance, an itinerary might suggest: "Day 1 in Tokyo: Start your morning with a traditional Japanese breakfast at [Qloo-recommended restaurant A], known for its [specific dish aligning with user taste]. In the afternoon, explore the Tsukiji Outer Market for fresh sushi and local snacks. For dinner, experience an authentic izakaya at [Qloo-recommended restaurant B], popular with locals who enjoy [user's preferred music genre]." The **travel and itinerary features are planned as part of a premium subscription tier, likely priced between $5 and $10 per month**, reflecting the higher value and complexity of this offering . Free tier users might be able to explore basic destination ideas generated by Qloo, but the detailed, LLM-generated itineraries would be a paid benefit. This feature directly addresses the growing trend of culinary tourism and the desire for culturally immersive travel experiences .

### 2.5. Community Engagement Features

To foster a sense of community and enhance user engagement, FlavorJourney plans to incorporate features that allow users to share their experiences and interact with each other. While the primary focus during the hackathon will be on the core recommendation engine, community features represent a valuable addition if time permits. These features would enable users to **rate and review recommended restaurants or travel destinations, share photos of their culinary discoveries, and post comments or tips** for other users. This user-generated content can significantly enrich the platform's data, providing real-world feedback and diverse perspectives that go beyond algorithmic recommendations. For example, a user might find a Qloo-recommended restaurant through their cultural profile, visit it, and then leave a review commenting on the atmosphere, service, and specific dishes they enjoyed, which can then inform other users considering the same venue.

The implementation of these community features would require a more robust backend setup, including a database (**PostgreSQL** is mentioned as an option) to store user-generated content such as reviews, ratings, photos, and forum-style posts . SvelteKit forms would be used for users to submit their content. A dedicated section of the app, perhaps a "Community" page or integrated feeds within recommendation details, would display this shared content. The inclusivity aspect here is that **these community features would be free for all users**, encouraging widespread participation regardless of subscription tier. This can help build a loyal user base and create a dynamic ecosystem around shared culinary interests. For the hackathon, a minimal viable version might include basic rating and short text review capabilities for restaurants. More advanced features like photo sharing, discussion forums, or user profiles with activity feeds would be part of a post-hackathon roadmap. The "MoodieFoodie" project also highlighted the importance of user interaction by using previous user moods and orders to suggest food, indicating the value of community-sourced data .

### 2.6. "All Popular/Recommended" Fallback & Exploration

To enhance user experience and provide alternative discovery paths, FlavorJourney will incorporate an **"All Popular" or "Editor's Picks" section**. This feature serves multiple purposes: it acts as a fallback for users who may not have strong initial preferences, don't wish to input their mood every time, or are new to the platform and haven't yet built a detailed taste profile. It also offers a general exploration page where users can browse a curated list of popular or highly-rated local dining spots and travel destinations. This section could display a mix of recommendations, potentially ranked by a combination of factors such as overall popularity (if Qloo provides such metrics), user ratings (if community features are implemented), or editorial curation. The content for this page could be generated by making generic queries to Qloo's API (e.g., requesting popular restaurants in a general category or popular travel destinations without specific user preferences) or by maintaining a static list of recommendations that are updated periodically. For a hackathon setting, a **semi-static list, perhaps with some dynamic elements pulled from Qloo, might be more feasible**. The "All Popular" page can also serve as a discovery tool, showcasing a diverse range of options that might inspire users to explore new cuisines or destinations they hadn't previously considered. If the LLM, when processing mood inputs, returns broader categories or genres (e.g., "Italian," "Adventure Travel") instead of specific entities, these could also be used to filter or populate sections within the "All Popular" page. The implementation would involve creating a new route in the SvelteKit application (e.g., `/popular` or `/explore`) and a corresponding page component (`+page.svelte`) to display the popular items. This feature aims to provide a low-friction entry point for users and ensure the app remains engaging even when users are not actively inputting specific preferences or moods.
