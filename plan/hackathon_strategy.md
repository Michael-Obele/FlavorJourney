# 6. Hackathon-Specific Optimization

### 6.1. Prioritization of Features for MVP

For the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to be submitted to the Qloo LLM Hackathon, feature prioritization is crucial to ensure a functional and compelling application within the limited timeframe. The core features that demonstrate the synergy between Qloo's API and the LLM will take precedence.

1.  **User Preference Input & Profile Creation**: This is foundational, as it provides the data for Qloo's recommendations. Must allow users to input cultural likes (music, books, etc.) and store them (initially local storage).
2.  **Personalized Local Dining Recommendations (Qloo Integration)**: A core feature showcasing Qloo's API. Users should receive restaurant suggestions based on their profile.
3.  **Mood-Based Culinary Suggestions (LLM + Qloo Integration)**: A key differentiator. Users should be able to describe their mood and get relevant local dining ideas, powered by Google Gemini interpreting input and Qloo providing personalized options.
4.  **Travel-Based Culinary Itineraries (LLM + Qloo Integration)**: Demonstrates advanced LLM use. Users should get destination suggestions from Qloo and then a basic LLM-generated culinary itinerary for a selected destination.
5.  **Basic UI/UX for all above features**: A clean, usable interface for SvelteKit frontend to interact with the Node.js backend.

**Lower Priority (Implement if time permits, otherwise document as future enhancements):**

- "All Popular/Recommended" Fallback & Exploration: Nice to have for discovery.
- Community Engagement Features: Valuable for engagement but adds backend/database complexity.
- Advanced Filtering for Local Dining: Can be part of a basic premium tier mockup.
- Full Monetization Logic: A basic Stripe integration or mock-up for tiered access is sufficient for the hackathon.

This prioritization ensures that the most critical aspects of the Qloo-LLM integration are demonstrated effectively in the MVP.

### 6.2. Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies

Developing FlavorJourney within a one-month hackathon timeframe involves several risks. Identifying these risks early and having mitigation strategies is crucial for success.

| Risk Category             | Specific Risk                                                  | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **API Integration**       | Qloo API complexity or unexpected behavior                     | Medium     | High   | Start integration early (Week 1). Thoroughly test endpoints. Have fallback plans if certain features (e.g., specific category filtering) don't work as expected. |
|                           | LLM (Gemini) API costs or rate limits                          | Low        | High   | Monitor API usage closely. Optimize prompts to reduce token consumption. Explore free tiers or hackathon credits.                                                |
| **Technical**             | Complexity of mapping LLM mood output to Qloo API parameters   | High       | High   | Start with a simpler mapping (e.g., keywords to Qloo search). Iterate. If too complex, LLM can provide direct suggestions enriched by Qloo if possible.          |
|                           | Frontend (SvelteKit) or Backend (Node.js) development delays   | Medium     | High   | Leverage existing expertise. Use well-understood libraries. Stick to MVP scope. Regular code commits and testing.                                                |
| **Time Management**       | Underestimating time for specific features or bug fixing       | High       | High   | Follow the phased timeline strictly. Prioritize MVP features. Be prepared to cut or simplify less critical features.                                             |
| **Submission**            | Issues with demo video creation or documentation               | Low        | High   | Start drafting documentation and video script early (Week 3). Keep it concise and focused on core features.                                                      |
| **External Dependencies** | Lack of detailed Qloo API documentation for specific use cases | Medium     | Medium | Make reasonable assumptions based on available info. Reach out to hackathon organizers for clarifications if stuck.                                              |

By proactively addressing these risks, the development process can be made smoother and the chances of a successful submission increased.

### 6.3. Submission Readiness (Demo Video, Documentation)

Preparing a compelling submission is as important as building the application itself for the Qloo LLM Hackathon. The submission will consist of several key components:

1.  **Functional Demo Application**: A live, deployed version of FlavorJourney accessible via a public URL. This will be hosted on platforms like Vercel (frontend) and Heroku/Render (backend).
2.  **Public Code Repository**: A GitHub repository containing all the source code for FlavorJourney. The repository must include a **clear and comprehensive README.md file**. This README should cover:
    - Project overview and motivation.
    - Key features implemented.
    - Technology stack used.
    - Setup instructions for local development (if applicable).
    - Instructions on how to run the demo (if different from the live URL).
    - Clear attribution for any third-party code or assets used.
    - Team information (if applicable).
3.  **Demo Video (2-3 minutes)**: A screencast video demonstrating FlavorJourney's functionality. The video should:
    - Clearly show the integration of Qloo's Taste AIâ„¢ API and Google Gemini LLM.
    - Walk through the key user flows: preference input, local dining recommendations, mood-based suggestions, and travel itinerary generation.
    - Highlight the innovative aspects and value proposition.
    - Be well-edited, with clear audio and visuals.
4.  **Text Description**: A concise text description of the project, as required by the Devpost submission form. This will summarize what FlavorJourney does, how it was built, the challenges faced, and the accomplishments.

All these materials will be prepared throughout the development process, with a focus on finalizing them in Week 4. The demo video script and storyboard will be drafted early to ensure all necessary features are captured effectively.
