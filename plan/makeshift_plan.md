# Makeshift Plan: FlavorJourney Hackathon Pivot

## Project Pivot: From Broad Features to Focused Results Page

Due to hackathon time constraints, we are pivoting our strategy from developing a broad set of features to focusing on delivering a single, highly polished results page experience. This concentrated effort will allow us to showcase the core value proposition of FlavorJourney effectively within the limited timeframe.

## New User Flow

The updated user journey will be streamlined and direct:

1.  **User fills out a form:** The user will interact with a single, clear form to input their preferences or search criteria.
2.  **Upon submission, the form is hidden:** Once the form is submitted, it will gracefully disappear from view.
3.  **The results are displayed:** The system will immediately present the recommendation results based on the user's input.
4.  **Return to form:** A clear and prominent "Start New Search" or similar button/link will be provided, allowing the user to easily return to the form to initiate a new set of recommendations.

## Card Redesign

The recommendation cards will undergo a redesign to enhance clarity and focus. The "keywords" concept will be removed entirely. Instead, we will focus on:

- **Concise Summaries:** Each card will feature a concise, AI-generated highlight or summary of the recommendation.
- **Specific Dish Recommendations (Optional):** If feasible, cards could include specific, highly-rated dish recommendations from the establishment. This will be explored if time permits and data allows.

## AI-Powered "Top 5"

A key feature of the results page will be an AI-powered "Top 5" selection.

- The AI model will analyze the full list of recommendations generated for the user.
- It will then identify and highlight the five best options based on its understanding of the user's preferences and the quality/relevance of the recommendations.
- This "Top 5" will serve as a curated, intelligent summary, helping users quickly identify prime choices.

## "Future Work" Messaging

To manage user expectations and set the stage for future development, the application's UI and copy will clearly communicate the MVP status:

- **Prominent UI elements:** Messages like "This is an MVP version" or "More features coming soon!" will be integrated into the results page or a dedicated section.
- **Clear Copy:** Text will emphasize that the current offering is a foundational experience, with plans for expanded features, personalization, and additional functionalities in subsequent iterations. This will ensure users understand that FlavorJourney is an evolving product.
