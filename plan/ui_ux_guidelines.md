# UI/UX Guidelines and Shadcn-Svelte Component Usage

This document outlines the UI/UX guidelines and recommended usage of Shadcn-Svelte components within this project. Adhering to these principles ensures a consistent, accessible, and high-quality user experience, alongside maintainability and proper integration of UI elements.

## General Principles

- **Prioritize Shadcn-Svelte Components**: For all UI elements, always utilize the corresponding Shadcn-Svelte component whenever possible. Avoid using raw HTML elements if a suitable Shadcn-Svelte component exists, to maintain visual and functional consistency.
- **Accessibility First**: All UI components and interactions must adhere to WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards. Pay attention to semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, focus management, and ARIA attributes.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the application is fully responsive and provides an optimal experience across various screen sizes and devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **Intuitive User Flow**: Design user flows to be clear, logical, and minimize cognitive load. Users should easily understand how to navigate and interact with the application.
- **Visual Consistency**: Maintain a consistent visual language across the application, including typography, color palette, spacing, and iconography.

## Forms

- **Standard HTML `<form>` Elements**: All forms _must_ be wrapped in standard HTML `<form>` elements to leverage native browser behavior and progressive enhancement.
- **Shadcn-Svelte Form Controls**: Within a `<form>` element, all interactive form controls (inputs, buttons, select elements, text areas, etc.) _must_ be the corresponding Shadcn-Svelte component. This ensures consistent styling, behavior, and accessibility features.

## Available Components

Below is a list of available Shadcn-Svelte components in [`src/lib/components/ui`](src/lib/components/ui). Refer to their respective directories for specific usage details and examples.

- [`badge`](src/lib/components/ui/badge)
- [`button`](src/lib/components/ui/button)
- [`card`](src/lib/components/ui/card)
- [`dialog`](src/lib/components/ui/dialog)
- [`input`](src/lib/components/ui/input)
- [`scroll-area`](src/lib/components/ui/scroll-area)
- [`select`](src/lib/components/ui/select)
- [`separator`](src/lib/components/ui/separator)
- [`tabs`](src/lib/components/ui/tabs)
- [`textarea`](src/lib/components/ui/textarea)

### Research Gaps Identified:

- **Shadcn-Svelte Component Customization**: Document best practices for customizing Shadcn-Svelte components (e.g., theming, extending styles) while maintaining upgradeability.
- **Complex UI Patterns**: Research and define guidelines for implementing more complex UI patterns not directly covered by existing Shadcn-Svelte components (e.g., data tables, drag-and-drop interfaces), potentially involving third-party libraries or custom solutions.
- **Accessibility Testing Strategy**: Outline a strategy for conducting comprehensive accessibility testing (e.g., using automated tools, manual checks, screen reader testing) to ensure WCAG compliance.
